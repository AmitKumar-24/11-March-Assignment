    "A t-test and z-test are statistical tests used to compare the means of two groups or samples. However, a t-test is used when the sample size is small, and the population standard deviation is unknown, while a z-test is used when the sample size is large, and the population standard deviation is known.\n",

    "For example, let's say that a certain disease affects 1 in 1000 people, and a new test has been developed that correctly identifies the disease in 99% of cases. If a person tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have the disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: P(Disease) = 0.001 (prior probability) P(Positive Test | Disease) = 0.99 (probability of testing positive given the person has the disease) P(Positive Test | No Disease) = 0.01 (probability of testing positive given the person does not have the disease) P(No Disease) = 0.999 (1 - prior probability)\n",
